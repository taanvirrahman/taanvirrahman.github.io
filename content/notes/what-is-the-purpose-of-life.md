## What is the purpose of life?

Life is not a problem to be solved; it is a quiet story unfolding, often without warning.  
We wake up one day and realize we are already in the middle of it.

> “জীবন খুব ছোট, কিন্তু আমরা একে অকারণে খুব জটিল করে ফেলি।”

Some days feel meaningless, some days feel magical, and most days are just ordinary—and that is their secret beauty. Ordinary days carry the real weight of life.

> “Life is not about being extraordinary every day; it is about surviving the ordinary ones with grace.”

The purpose of life is not hidden in big achievements or loud success.  
It lives in small moments—a cup of tea that tastes better than usual, a sudden memory that makes us smile, a person who listens without interrupting.

> “মানুষ বড় কিছু হতে চায়, অথচ মানুষ হয়ে থাকাটাই সবচেয়ে কঠিন কাজ।”

We keep searching for grand meanings, but life gently laughs and says—look closer.

> “Life doesn’t give answers. It gives moments. The meaning is something we quietly add ourselves.”

Perhaps the purpose of life is simply this—to live honestly, to love imperfectly, to be curious, and to leave behind a little kindness.

> “ভালো মানুষ হওয়াটা কোনো বড় অর্জন না, কিন্তু পৃথিবীর সবচেয়ে জরুরি কাজ।”

And when the story ends, it should feel like a simple sentence written with care—  
not too dramatic, not too empty.

> “শেষে জীবন যদি একটু শান্ত লাগে, তাহলেই বুঝতে হবে—ঠিকভাবে বেঁচে ছিলাম।”

Just… complete.
