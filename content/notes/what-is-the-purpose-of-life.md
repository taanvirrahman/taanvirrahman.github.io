# What is the purpose of life?

Life is a journey, not a destination. It is a process of growth, learning, and evolution. The purpose of life is to live it to the fullest, to experience all that it has to offer, and to leave a positive impact on the world.

## simple explanation

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	purpose := []string{"growth", "learning", "evolution"}
	for _, p := range purpose {
		fmt.Printf("Experiencing %s...\n", p)
	}
	fmt.Println("Goal: Leave a positive impact on the world.")
}

```
