# Why I use IBM Plex Mono for everything

IBM Plex Mono is more than just a typeface. It represents the perfect balance between the industrial, technical world of computing and the human accessibility of well-designed letterforms.

### Technical Precision

It looks great in code editors, terminal windows, and minimalist websites. The spacing is consistent, making it easy to read long blocks of text.

### The Identity

Using a monospace font across my entire portfolio conveys a specific brand:

1. **Clarity**
2. **Transparency**
3. **Engineering Focus**

It's the font of the future, rooted in the history of the past.
